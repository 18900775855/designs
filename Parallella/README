Parallella clip case
====================

This case is designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

I used 10mm long M2.5 nylon bolts to hold the board to the base with
nylon washers underneath the board as spacers.

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
