Orange Pi PC H3 CPU heatsink
============================

Each heatsink is roughly 50g finished weight and has over 2200 square
millimetres of surface area to dissipate heat over.

See the image for the results.

Method
------

This design was realised with a lathe, mill and bandsaw

The operations were:

 - 150mm length of 25mm round bar copper stock in three jaw chuck on lathe

 - end face and make hole for lathe centre.

 - rod turned round and turned down to 20mm for 20mm of length to fit
   20mm collet on mills rotary table chuck

 - on mill rod mounted between rotary table chuck and a centre.

 - centre slitting saw height at the centre of the copper rod

 - using a 1mm slitting saw cut 4mm deep grooves (ideally 6mm but in
   my case the centre and rotary table would foul cuts deeper than 4mm)

 - rotate table 40 degrees and repeat until all nine slots cut.

 - use bandsaw to slice off 13mm lengths, parting soft material like
   copper on a lathe really does not work (why yes i do need to buy a
   new insert for my parting tool) take it slow and let it cool down
   between cuts or it becomes very difficult to handle and may jam.

 - put the sections back in the lathe and face both sides. I also
   bevelled the bottom edges which removes some sharp edges.
 
 - clean thoroughly and ensure no copper swarf remains to get on your
   delicate electronics.

 - use some thermal tape and attach to CPU
