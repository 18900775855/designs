This stool is designed to be cut from 18mm plywood.

It uses interference fit joints 17.5mm wide assuming a sheet material
with uniform 17.7mm thickness. If your material is more than 0.1mm
different to this the joints may not fit properly.

It has been designed with a metric 6mm end mill in mind

Layer 0 is the through sheet profile cut.

The vcarve pro 7 .crv files are what I used to generate the gcode (tap
files) and may or may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths
with my name and makespace text in.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
