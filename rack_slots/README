19inch rack enclosure for slimlibe SBC cases
============================================

This enclosure is designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic. The
enclosure is a 1U high 19inch rack unit in which five of my slimline
single board computer cases can be placed. Such cases are currently
available for the Orange Pi PC and the Raspberry Pi B+

The overall design is one of a box girder which provides suprising
structural rigidity, certianly when fully loaded there is no excessive
flex in use.

The parts are bolted together with 

 - 20 x 10mm long M3 bolts for main structure 
 - 8 x 12mm long M3 bolts for the front panel.
 - 8 x 3mm washers for front panel locks
 - 28 x M3 nuts

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

 - Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.
 - Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts
 - Layer 2 (blue) is teh inner connector cut and should be first
 - Layer 3 (green) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
