Raspberry Pi B+ or 2B slimline clip case
========================================

This case is designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic. The case is
for either the Raspberry Pi B+ or Raspberry Pi 2 B as both are
physically similar.

This design has a top that can be easily flipped open to get access
and is several mm shorter than previous designs. The top cover being
level with the top of the USB connectors.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

I used 10mm long M2.5 nylon bolts to hold the board to the base with
five 0.5mm nylon washers underneath the board as spacers.

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

There is a a small issues with the design in that the ÂµSD card slot is
very fiddly to access and you need fingernails to extract a card.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
