Ultrabay Enclosure
==================

This case is designed to be laser cut from 3mm and 5mm acrylic. It
forms a four bay enclosure for Lenovo Ultrabay drives.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

There are three dxf files the first two are to be cut from 3mm
material and are only split for my convenience in fabrication. Sheet
three is to be cut from 5mm material and forms support slides.

Assembly is somewhat fiddly but everything does go together. The
easiest approach seems to be to start with the right side wall flat on
a desk and assemble parts onto the slots, then add the left side and
back and front.

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
