This folding chair is designed to be cut from 24mm plywood though any
timber with sufficient bending resitance should suffice.

It has been designed with a metric 6mm end mill in mind

The design is double sided and the layers represent different types of
cut.

Layer 0 is the through sheet profile cut the others are hinge rebates
and decoration.

The vcarve pro 7 .crv files are what I used to generate the gcode (tap
files) and may or may not be useful to you.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
