96Boards Consumer Enclosure
===========================

This enclosure is designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic. The case
is for a 96boards "consumer" board format. It can accommodate either A
or B depth boards although has only been tested with a HiKey type A.

There are three layers within the design:

 - The bottom layer has holes for fastening a standard 3.5 inch SATA
   hard drive.

 - The next layer has mounting holes for an "Amazon basics" USB 2 hub
   circuit board.

 - The top layer has mounting provision for the 96board and cutouts
   for a USB Ethernet adaptor and USB serial adaptor.

The USB Ethernet and serial adaptors I used were ordered from eBay so
almost certainly what you get will need different mountings.

This design has a top that can be easily flipped open to get access.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

I used nylon bolts to hold the boards to the base with
five 0.5mm nylon washers underneath the board as spacers.

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

There is a a small issues with the design in that the ÂµSD card slot is
very fiddly to access and you need fingernails to extract a card.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
