Pine64 Board dimensions
=======================

The Pine64 project has not released a full set of dimensions for their
board (as of April 2016). I have carefully measured my board and
produced these drawings and CAD models.

These drawings and models are based on a single board and subject to
my measuring tolerances so must not be used as a reference without
checking.

I am releasing these files in the hope someone else will find them
useful but cannot be responsible for any errors.
