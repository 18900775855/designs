Raspberry Pi B clip case
========================

This case is designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic. The case is
for the original Raspberry Pi B.

This design has a top that is fixed and just allows fitting of a
pi-light.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

Using 1/8th inch acrylic does not work with this design!

The board is unsecured as there are no mounting holes.

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
