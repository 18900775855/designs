Banana Pi clip case
===================

These cases are designed to be laser cut from 3mm or 1/8inch acrylic.

The tolerances are very close but the design has been successfully
realised, though even the protective plastic covering upsets the slot
sizes enough to cause issues.

The imperial file has the clearences for 1/8th inch the metric version
will not fit.

I used 10mm long M3 nylon bolts to hold the board to the base with
nylon washers underneath the board as spacers.

Layer 0 (black) is the through sheet profile cut.

Layer 1 (red) is the connector and slot cutouts

Layer 2 (yellow) is the text

The lasercut files are what I used to create my prototypes and may or
may not be useful to you. They contain the toolpaths with my name and
the licence text in.

There are a couple of small issues with the design:

 - The SD card slot is very fiddly to access

This is a working design and has been made by me but I offer no
guarantee that it will work for you.
